"""
This module implements a BackgroundTreeBuilder encapsulating a QTextDocument.

Because it knows the document, it has access to the text, and therefore
we implement root_lexicon() and set_root_lexicon() here.

The TreeBuilder emits the updated(start, end) signal whenever new tokens
are generated.
